-- SUMMARY --

jReject:
Often times, either through lack of manpower or will, we'll create a web page 
that looks great in modern browsers but falls apart in old ones. Rather than 
fielding comments like "Your page is broken!!", wouldn't it be nice to let your 
visitors know that their browser is out of date?

jReject is a jQuery plugin that determines the browser type and version a 
visitor is using, and conditionally presents the user with a modal message 
prompting them to upgrade their browser.

The jReject jQuery plugin was created by Steven Bower (http://turnwheel.com), 
and based on the "IE6 Upgrade Warning" script by mihai.ile@gmail.com. It is 
released under a dual MIT/GPL license. The jReject for Drupal 7 module was 
created by Domenic Santangelo (entendu) http://drupal.org/user/173461.

jReject for Drupal 7:
jReject for Drupal 7 is a module that lets you plug-and-play jReject with a 
minimum amount of effort. It includes a comprehensive set of administrative 
screens that enables you to tweak jReject's many options without touching a 
single line of code.

For a full description of the module, visit the project page:
  http://drupal.org/project/jreject
